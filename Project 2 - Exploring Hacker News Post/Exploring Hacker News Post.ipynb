    "On this project we will look into data from a social news website called Hacker News. The goal of this project is to understand what type of posts are likely to receive higher engagement. On Hacker News, users can submit stories that other people can vote or comment on. We will use this [data](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts) from Kaggle throughout this project. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will perform the following analysis to arrive to our conclusion:\n",
    " * Compare `Ask HN` and `Show HN` posts\n",
    " * Explore whether posts that are created at a certain time receives more comments on avarage\n",

    "### Summary of Results\n",
    "\n",
    "`Ask HN` posts that are created around 3 PM EST are more likely to receive comments. On our data set, `Ask HN` posts receive 112.7% more comments compared to `Show HN` posts. Therefore, if a user is interested in posting on Hacker News, he or she should post `Ask HN` type of post at 3 PM EST.\n",
